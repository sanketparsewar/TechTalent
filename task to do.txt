Sure, below is an example of a typical corporate hierarchy, starting with the highest level:

Founder/Chairman/CEO - This is the person who started the company or is in charge of running the organization. They have ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of the company.

Board of Directors - This group is responsible for overseeing the company's operations and making major decisions about its direction. They are appointed by the CEO and are usually made up of experienced business leaders and industry experts.

Senior Management/Executive Team - This group includes the company's top-level executives, such as the President, COO, CFO, and CMO. They are responsible for setting the company's strategy and ensuring that it is implemented effectively.

Middle Management - This group includes department heads, managers, and supervisors who are responsible for overseeing specific areas of the business, such as marketing, sales, finance, or operations.

Professional/Technical Staff - These are the individuals who have specialized skills or knowledge that are critical to the success of the company. They may include engineers, scientists, lawyers, and other professionals.

Support Staff - This group includes administrative assistants, receptionists, and other support personnel who provide assistance to other employees.

Workers/Clerks - These are the employees who perform the day-to-day tasks of the company, such as manufacturing, customer service, and data entry.

It's important to note that not all companies follow this exact hierarchy, and the titles and roles of employees may vary depending on the industry and size of the organization.
